<h1>How to create a nightly</h1>

<p>To create a nightly, you need to configure the nightly, write a
script, make it produce output, and possibly customize the
nightly.</p>

<h2>Configuring the nightly</h2>

<p>
  To make a nightly, first, make sure the code you want to test
  nightly is in a public Github repository. Add your repository to the
  %if confurl:
   <a href="{{confurl}}">nightly configuration</a>.
  %else:
   nightly configuration.
  %end
  If you don't have access, ask someone who does.
</p>

<p>You'll want to add a block like this to your configuration:</p>

<pre>
[username/reponame]
slack=channelname
timeout=1hr
report=report/
</pre>

<p>It is polite to make a PR on the nightly configuration repository
and ping someone who knows nightlies to review it.</p>

<p>If you are using a new channel name, you'll need to get in touch
with someone who knows the nightly system so they can add a new Slack
key to the secrets file.</p>

<h2>Scripting the nightly</h2>

<p>Once you have added your repository to the configuration file,
you'll need to script the nightly itself. To do so, add
a <code>Makefile</code> to the root of your repository and add a rule
in it called <code>nightly</code>. This typically means adding this
code to the file:</p>

<pre>
nightly:
	bash infra/nightly.sh
</pre>

<p>Note that this is a makefile so it's important to use a real TAB
character to indent the second line. The command on the second line is
arbitrary, but we usually recommend putting all the actual nightly
code in a shell script somewhere. That way you're coding in shell, not
makefile.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend starting that script with</p>

<pre>
set -e -x
</pre>

<p>This tells the script to fail if any command fails, and to print
each command that it executes. This helps a lot when debugging.</p>

<p>The script should now run every night if there's been a commit on
the previous day.</p>

<h2>Producing nightly output</h2>

<p>At first, you might script your nightly to just compile and run
your code, just checking whether or not it crashes. However, you will
pretty soon want to measure stuff (run times, results, and so on) so
you know how well your research is working. Nightlies make that
easy.</p>

<p>Modify your nightly script to generate output. Usually the output
should be a single directory (call it <code>report</code>, matching the
<code>report</code> key in the config file) with
an <code>index.html</code> file. That file can contain the most
important results, plots, and tables, and also link to any other files
you might generate as output.</p>

<p>Now when the nightly runs, that directory will be archived and the
nightly Slack message will have a button to go to
the <code>index.html</code> file.</p>

<h2>Customizing the nightly</h2>

<p>Here are some additional properties you can pass in the
configuration file to change how your nightly behaves.</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>report</code></dt>
<dd>The path to the report directory relative to the repository root.
This directory is published after each nightly run.</dd>

<dt><code>image</code></dt>
<dd>The path to an image relative to the <em>report directory</em>.
This image is attached to any Slack message when the branch finishes
running.</dd>

<dt><code>gzip</code></dt>
<dd>A space-separated list of globs, like <code>*.json</code>, which
identify files in the report directory that can be compressed before
storage. The web server is configured to unzip those files before
serving them, so you don't need to adjust links or do anything else.
Typically projects zip JSON, log, and CSV files, but not HTML/CSS/JS
or images.</dd>

<dt><code>warn_log</code></dt>
<dd>Warn if the log file exceeds this size (default <code>1MB</code>,
which is 1MiB). Sizes may use units like <code>500KB</code> or
<code>2MB</code>. Use <code>0</code> to disable warnings (not
recommended).</dd>

<dt><code>warn_report</code></dt>
<dd>Warn if the report directory exceeds this size
(default <code>1GB</code>, which is 1GiB). The warning includes the
largest file and its location in the report directory. Sizes may use
units like <code>500MB</code> or <code>2GB</code>. Use
<code>0</code> to disable warnings (not recommended).</dd>

<dt><code>warn_branch</code></dt>
<dd>Warn if the branch worktree exceeds this size after the run
completes (default <code>10GB</code>). The warning includes the
largest file and its location in the branch directory. Sizes may use
units like <code>5GB</code> or <code>20GB</code>. Use
<code>0</code> to disable warnings (not recommended).</dd>

<dt><code>slack</code></dt>
<dd>The Slack channel to post your nightly results to. The value of
this property isn't actually the channel name; instead, it's a key in
the secrets file. If you need to use a new channel that isn't already
in use by another nightly, get in touch with the nightly maintainers
to add it.</dd>

<dt><code>apt</code></dt>
<dd>You can pass a list of Debian packages to install before running
your nightly. For example, if your code is written in Rust, you can
pass <code>apt=cargo</code> to make sure that Cargo is installed.
Debian packages are the preferred way to manage dependencies. If you
have some dependency that you absolutely can't install from a package,
get in touch with the nightly maintainers.</dd>

<dt><code>ppa</code></dt>
<dd>A space-separated list of PPA repositories (like
<code>ppa:owner/name</code>) to enable before installing Debian
packages. Invalid repositories are skipped and reported as warnings.</dd>

<dt><code>timeout</code></dt>
<dd>You can give a timeout (written <code>4hr</code> or similar).
After the timeout is over, your nightly will be killed. This is
useful, because if you accidentally make your nightly run forever,
then other people's nightlies won't run and they will be mad.</dd>

<dt><code>always</code>, <code>never</code></dt>
<dd>A list of branches to either always or never run, regardless of
whether they have a recent comment. <code>always</code> is sometimes
useful for fuzzing projects, while <code>never</code> is sometimes
useful if you have a project web page or similar on a branch.</dd>

<dt><code>baseline</code></dt>
<dd>Names a branch that should be run if any other branch is run. This
helps if you want to do like-with-like comparisons on feature
branches.</dd>

<dt><code>main</code></dt>
<dd>The name of the main branch, if it's not <code>main</code>.</dd>

<dt><code>cores</code></dt>
<dd>The number of CPU cores your nightly requires. Use a number like
<code>2</code> for jobs that don't need the full machine, or
<code>all</code> for jobs that need exclusive access (the default). Jobs
requesting fewer cores can run concurrently with other jobs.</dd>

<dt><code>memory</code></dt>
<dd>The maximum memory your nightly is allowed to use, like
<code>8gb</code> or <code>512mb</code>. If your job exceeds this limit,
it will be killed. By default, there is no memory limit.</dd>
